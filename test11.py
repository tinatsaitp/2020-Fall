#Name: Yun-Ting Tsai

#Objective: The user should move the ball
#           to the goal 10 times to win the Game.
#Rule: In each round, the user have 15 seconds to move the ball to the goal.
#      If the user's time is up in any round, they will lose the Game.
#      In other words, the user should move the ball to the goal within 15 seconds,
#      and they need to repeat this action 10 times(rounds) to win the Game. 
#Input: The user can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the ball to the goal.
